I have created this program to toss a coin and get the result either heads or tails. I have used a keyword and module to do my program.

DEF(Keyword):
            Def is a keyword that is used to define a function. This keyword is placed before the function name provided by the user.

   Random(Module):
                  Random is an in-built module in Python that is used to pick random numbers. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random 
                  number or printing a random value from a list. I have listed a few functions present in the random module:
				  
	  randrange()
It is used to return a random number within the range

      randint()

It is used to return a random integer within the range

      choice()

It is used to return a random item present in a list or tupule.

I have used choice() function and created list to check whether it is heads or tails.
